= JeeTS Web Spring Traccar

This project forms the base of any Spring (Boot Starter) application.
The idea is to wrap the *Traccar Open API Client* into role based
Spring Security and provide an easy to use Traccar Model.
So the project is actually a Spring-*Traccar-Model* Component
and you can easily create your own *Controllers* and *Views*
for your own purposes.


// == Architecture

// TODO 

// The core of the JeeTS Web is a Spring _MVC_ Component 

// to supply the original *Traccar Model* 

// with _Spring's Role Based Security_. 

// Easy to use with _Spring Boot Starters_ 

// to develop individual *Controllers and Views*.
